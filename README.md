Telecom Churn

Problem Statement

Analyze the telecom churn dataset to uncover key business insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), understand customer churn patterns, and develop a classification model to predict customer churn.

Business Use Cases

Customer Retention Analysis: Identify factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to improve retention.

Usage Pattern Analysis: Understand customer usage patterns to offer tailored services and improve customer satisfaction.

Risk Assessment: Develop a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churning.

Approach

Data Import and Preparation

Import the dataset into a Python environment.

Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting data types.

Remove any personal identifiers or location-specific details to ensure privacy.

Perform necessary transformations, such as creating new calculated fields.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of key variables.

Visualizations:

Distribution of customer tenure (Account Length).

Monthly charges distribution.

Count of customers by churn status.

Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between numeric features, such as total minutes used and total charges.

Distribution Analysis:

Account Length Distribution: Identify common customer lifespans.

Total Minutes and Charges Distribution: Explore how total minutes and charges vary across different customer segments.

Churn Status Distribution: Visualize the count of customers by their churn status.

Business Insights

Churn Rate by Contract Type: Analyze churn rates across different contract types (e.g., month-to-month, one year, two years).

International and Voice Mail Plan Impact: Study the relationship between having an international plan or voice mail plan and churn rates.

Customer Service Calls Impact: Assess how the number of customer service calls affects churn rates.

Classification Modeling

Feature Selection: Identify key features that influence customer churn, such as tenure, monthly charges, and service usage.

Model Development:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train various classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) to predict customer churn.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Interpretation: Use techniques like variable importance to interpret model predictions and understand the impact of each feature.

Additional Questions for Analysis

Impact of International Plan: Determine if having an international plan significantly affects churn rates.

Impact of Voice Mail Plan: Analyze if customers with a voice mail plan have different churn rates compared to those without.

Customer Service Calls: Examine the relationship between the number of customer service calls and churn rates.

Usage Patterns: Compare usage patterns (total minutes and charges) between churned and non-churned customers.
